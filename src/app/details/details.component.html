    <h2>Improve Communications</h2>
    <p>
      Organizing a large-scale event requires sharing detailed location
      information with a wide range of audiences. Attendees need to know where
      to check in, vendors need to know where to unload and police & fire need
      to know exactly where their details are located.
    </p>
    <h2 class="paragraph">Reduce Event Stress</h2>
    <p>
      The problem with sharing all of this information is that traditional
      methods like event signage and volunteer “ambassadors” can be inefficient
      and often don’t work as planned. That’s where we come in.
      <span style="background-color: yellow"
        >Our event site maps have robust geolocation features that provide
        instant directions for all event participants so everyone can easily find
        where they need to be</span
      >, eliminating the stress of getting lost or being in the wrong place at
      the wrong time. With our app, managing events has never been easier.
